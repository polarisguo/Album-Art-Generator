# Album Art Generator

![Preview](/Preview.jpg)

Album Art Generator, the name is self-explanatory. This is a Rainmeter skin designed to make it easy to create album art without paying for expensive software or using free alternatives that come with a steep learning curve. Obviously, because it's just Rainmeter, an image with text on top of it is the most you're going to get out of this. The images are located in `@Resources\Images`, and you can scroll through them in the skin by scrolling on the image. The images are in alphabetical order. You can also quickly access the folder by right-clicking the skin and pressing "Open image folder". Here, you can also access the settings.
